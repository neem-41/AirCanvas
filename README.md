# AirCanvas

Air Canvas is a computer vision project, where users can write on a virtual whiteboard whithout the use of mouse of trackpads.Throughout the pandemic we saw how a normal
classroom can quickly turn into a virutal boxes on a computer screen. Likewise, we also saw how a normal whiteboard can quickly turn into a virtual one where we write by 
using a mouse of a trackpad instead of a marker. While taking one class online, I realized how difficult it is to write with a mouse or a trackpad on a virtual whiteboard.
This experience inspired me to try and create a computer vision application where one can write on a virtual space with just moving theirs fingers in air. The main goal
of the project was to create an application that users can use with ease removing some of hurdles of using technologies. This project is the accumulation of my interest 
in computer vision and also a test to see if ideas can be turned into actual code.

To use the application, please make sure that you have OpenCV and MediaPipe are installed in your computer. On a bash terminal this can be easily done with the following code:

python -m pip install opencv </br>
python -m pip install mediapipe</br>

The save.dat file is an example of what a saved workspace looks like and the image is an example of a saved workspace as an image.

To use the program, download all the files, install the packages and simply run </br>
python AirCanvas.py in python
